# Teste Softplan

## ‚úèÔ∏è Introduction

Repository for Softplan related to the Front-end PL developer position. I created an application that includes a login, a user table with CRUD options for a specific user profile, and user session management through [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and cookies. 
I chose Vite as my React development tool due to personal preference and fondness for it. My focus was on maintaining high-quality code, keeping it simple, easy to read, understand, and modify. I selected Tailwind and Shadcn/UI to facilitate component development 
and allow me to concentrate on the application's business logic. Lastly, I chose Vitest + React Testing Library for automated testing. The front-end and back-end repositories for this test are separate because, as the position is for front-end development, 
I kept the functionalities to be evaluated in the main repository and the API in another. The link to the API for more details is in the features section.

## üåê Demo

https://teste-softplan.vercel.app/

## üë• Login

To access the application, a username and password are required. I have already provided some users in the mock database. If you want to log in as an `admin`, you can use the username `admin@admin.com` and the password `admin1234`. Alternatively, if you want to log in as a `user`, you can use the username `user2@user.com` and the password `user2password`.

## üìã Features

- [x] The application includes login and password protection;
- [x] Two types of roles (admin and user);
- [x] Ttable with all registered users;
- [x] The table features search and pagination;
- [x] It's possible to create, edit, delete, and view a user (CRUD);
- [x] The logged-in user has the option to view their profile and change their password;
- [x] The application includes automated tests;
- [x] The application consumes the [API](https://github.com/nardini-22/teste-softplan-api) also created by me.

## üëî Business rules

- [x] The user with admin access can perform CRUD operations on other users and view them;
- [x] The user with user access will only be able to view the users in the system.
